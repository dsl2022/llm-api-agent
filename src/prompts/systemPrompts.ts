     and the name from these objects based on your analysis,the method includes such as GET, PATCH, PUT,POST or DELETE, as an JSON string. your answer must follow this exact pattern {"endpoint":"/someendpoint","method":"somemethod", name:"someName"}, no additional
      words should be included. please make sure the endpoint you give has to match the one you find from the JSON I gave you earlier. If you can not find any endpoint that is relevant,then make 100% sure to answer exactly {"error":"no endpoint is a good fit"`;
